🧠 Machine Learning – Learning in Public

This repository documents my journey of learning machine learning in public.  
It contains my hands-on work, experiments, notes, and mini-projects as I build strong fundamentals and practical skills.

The goal of this repo is simple:
learn by doing, stay consistent, and build visible proof of work for internships and future opportunities.
